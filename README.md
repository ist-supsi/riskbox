# riskbox
Collection of GRASS modules to accomplish risk assesment and evaluation developed in the past years at the Geospatial Division in SUPSI (University of Applied Sciences and Arts of Southern Switzerland).

## modules
* TRIGRS: python scripts to run the TRIGRS model for Shallow landslide vulnerability assessment within GRASS
* r.conefall: module for fast estimation of rock fall hazard
* r.damflood: module to estimate the flooding due to dam failure (use shallow water equations)
* r.dfwalk/r.dfwalk_v2: module to estimate debris flow hazard using a random walk approach
* r.hazard.class: module to asses the hazard classes based on defined boundaries
* r.impact.tsunami: module to estimate tsunami generation due to rock/landslide impact
* r.massmov: module to estimate the runout of fast landslide
* r.massmov.calibration: module to calibrate massmov
* r.massmove.sensitivity: module to estimate parameter sensitivity of massmov
* r.sum.mean: module to estimate mean solar irradiation
* r.swe: modules that applies the shallow water equation starting from a water elevation model
* r.tsunami: empirical estmation of tsunami propagation in sea
* r.ucode: integration of UCODE calibration & sensitivity module in GRASS

# NOTES:
the modules have been mostly developed for GRASS version 6 and most probably need to be upgraded to version 7.
Volunteers for upgrading and setting up a testing dataset are more then welcome.
